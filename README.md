Welcome to the GoogleJSON wiki!

Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.

Gson Goals

Provide simple toJson() and fromJson() methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa

Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON

Extensive support of Java Generics

Allow custom representations for objects

Gson 2.3.1 downloads at Maven Central
